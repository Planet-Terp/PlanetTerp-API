	<code>slug</code> is PlanetTerp's identifier for professors. Slugs are unique to a professor and are used on professor pages. It is often a professor's last name, but this is not guaranteed. You may not need to use a professor's slug, but if you want a unique identifier for professors, or want to link to a professor's page on PlanetTerp (<code>https://planetterp.com/professor/SLUG</code>), you can use a professor's slug.<br /><br />
	For example, Jon Snow's slug might be <code>snow</code>.
